I'm a software engineer at My MedicalHub, where I've been leading the Backend team for the last three years.
With a major in computer science, I graduated from Rajshahi University, Bangladesh in 2014.
The most prestigious Prime Minister Gold Medal in the field of education was awarded to me for being the top student in our Engineering Faculty.
Since my childhood, I was always fascinated by computers, so I chose that field of study.
Over the past seven years, I have worked in software engineering. As a team leader, I typically manage five to seven developers at any given time, and I'm passionate about processes.
Prior to my senior role, I worked for Toggi services as a junior software engineer. There, I worked mainly for ERP system. Iâ€™m very much skilled with .NET Framework.
Iâ€™m always passionate about creating quality products that meet all of the customerâ€™s needs, and I love learning new techniques and technologies that allow me to make that happen.
